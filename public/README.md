Find at: https://campustrends.herokuapp.com/

Implemented Scenarios:

1.	Search Trends:
    	Using the Twitter API, users will be able to search for keywords, and have information, such as number of results returned and total “likes”. Users may also filter by start date.
2.	Check Recent Searches:
    	The “show trends” button will show the three most recent search keywords. Users can use this to get an idea of what they might want to search for.
3.	Registration (updated to React):
        Users can use the signup page to register using an email and password. Email is checked for uniqueness. After registration, users can login using this information.
4.	View Trends:
    After a search, D3.js bar chart will appear to show the trend results over time.
    
Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 should be tested for homework 8.
